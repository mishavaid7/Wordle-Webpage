        <p> Some days you are so close to figuring out the Wordle of the day but your brain knows only so many 5-letter words ending in -th.  </p>
        <p> When accepting defeat is not an option, you simply have to Google the answer. The fear of losing my 17-day win streak weighs heavier than my dignity on most days. </p>
        <p> Wordle, which was made public in October 2021, is addictive by nature. We already know that everyone is playing it. But is everyone also cheating on it? </p>
        <p> I wanted to look at Google Trends data to grasp just how many people were searching for the answer. I started by comparing "wordle" as a search term with other topics that are trending at the moment. </p>
        <p> But this doesn't tell us about the cheating. Next I looked at data for the search "Wordle of the day". </p>

        <p> The New York Times bought Wordle in late January and this chart might confirm our sneaking suspicion that they made the game harder since the acquisition. </p>
        <iframe title="  Wordle of the day searches spiked exponentially since it was acquired." aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Y5WJq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Y5WJq/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="300"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

        <p> According to the guy who made Google Trends, "those 'spikes' are a sudden acceleration of search interest in a topic, compared to usual search volume. We know these are interesting because they are often reflective of what’s going on in the real world".
